## Page Descriptions:
1. **index.html**: The homepage introduces the company and highlights the services we offer with a welcome message.
2. **services.html**: This page showcases the services we provide, including images, descriptions, and details for each service.
3. **contact.html**: A contact form that allows users to get in touch with the company.

## Summary of Features Used:
1. **Selectors**:
   - Used selectors like `.hero-content`, `.service-card`, and `header nav` to style the content and elements of the webpage.

2. **Flexbox**:
   - Used **Flexbox** for the navigation bar (`nav ul`), main content sections (`.main-content`), and the hero banner to align and distribute content.

3. **CSS Grid**:
   - Implemented **CSS Grid** in the `.services-grid` section to display the services in a responsive grid layout.

4. **Media Queries**:
   - Used media queries to create responsive layouts for different screen sizes. Breakpoints are set at `1024px`, `768px`, and `480px` to ensure the website is optimized for tablets and mobile devices.

5. **Animation**:
   - Used the `@keyframes` CSS animation to create a fade-in effect on the hero banner heading.

6. **Hover/Focus Effects**:
   - Added hover and focus effects to the navigation links and service cards to improve user interaction and accessibility.
